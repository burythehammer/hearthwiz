# hearthWiz

A light website for tracking and managing Hearthstone card collections, written in Ruby on Rails.

A personal project intended to be deployed on my own website.

# Current features
- A basic index page of all cards
- A basic card page with details about that card
- Data from the Hearthstone JSON project

# Planned features
- Filters and sorting of the card index page
- Making the site actually look nice
- Better card view page
- Pictures of each card, god forbid, no idea how to get these cards other than (sigh) manually
- User login. Salting and SHA hashing of passwords for MVP.
- A personal list to maintain your own private collection of hearthstone cards
- Simple and quick 'add' page so that users can add their own cards as they open packs
- Simple deck builder and maintainer
- Some sort of deck import function from popular websites
- Quick ways to add hearthstone cards from your collection (search as you type?)
- Tracking of how much dust you have
