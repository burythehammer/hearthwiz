# hearthWiz

A light website for tracking and managing Hearthstone card collections, written in Ruby on Rails.

A personal project intended to be deployed on my own website.

# Current features
- A responsive list page of all cards
- A card page with some basic details about that card
- Data from the Hearthstone JSON project
- A nice, minimalist site layout

# Planned features
- Filters and sorting of the card index page
- More stuff on the card page (common cards it is paired with, classes commonly played with, etc)
- Card images natively from the assets
- Secure user login.
- Ability to 'save' cards to your own collection.
- Simple and quick 'add' page so that users can add their own cards as they open packs
- Simple deck builder and maintainer
- Some sort of deck import function from popular websites
- Quick ways to add hearthstone cards from your collection (search as you type?)
- Tracking of how much dust you have
